# Overview

{The purpose of this assginment is to show that I understand the basics of SQL and know how to use it with a database as well as to create tables, insert data, query data, modify data, and delete data. This program creates a simple data base of books and their authors, then the database is modified accordingly.}

# Relational Database

{I used SQLite to crate a library.db file.}

{The stucture I chose is a simple one that holds the names and authors names. I hope to add more tables and link them together in the future.}

# Development Environment
{I ended up useing SQLite3 for this project. It creates a library database. I used python and used SQL to query, modify and delete the database. }
